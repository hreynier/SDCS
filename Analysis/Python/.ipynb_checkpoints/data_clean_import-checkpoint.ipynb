    "Up to this point on the course we have been working with nice, clean, structured datasets. This is all very nice, but not very realistic. In the real world, datasets will arrive at your door in a bad shape - full of errors, null values and unreliability. You need to know how to approach these datasets, how to understand their limitations, and how to make repairs where necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week's workshop will explore how we can use tools in Python to import, clean, analyse and export new datasets. Specifically we'll be working with the **Pandas Data Analysis Library** (http://pandas.pydata.org), which you may have used elsewhere. During this tutorial, we'll work through an example data cleaning process, finishing with uploading the data directly to your MySQL Database. You'll learn how to approach new datasets, but further expand your skills in using Pandas.\n",

    "So without further ado, the first thing we need to do is setup our working environment. **Run the scripts below to import the Pandas libraries.**"

    "Pandas has a range of functions for enabling the import of data into Python. The import functions are relatively straight forward to use, and require very little in the way actual coding. There are also functions available for a range of different data formats.\n",

    "In this initial section of the workshop, we will explore how to import CSV data using Pandas. Other data formats (e.g. Excel, JSON, HTML) can be imported will similar ease, the documentation for these tools can be found here: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html\n",
    "\n",
    "An important thing to know about Pandas is that it will always load your data into its own Dataframe format. This format basically acts as a multicolumn table, and so will eventually make loading our cleaned data into MySQL all the more easier. However, before we get to that stage, we need to load the data in, check it for problems and fix it up.\n",

    "During this part of the workshop we'll be working with air quality data obtained from the *London Air Quality Network* (http://www.londonair.org.uk). Understanding air quality is clearly a very important element of ensuring wellbeing in urban areas. However, the data is highly prone to errors and mistakes, and so requires careful handling and analysis.\n",
